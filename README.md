# 50 Days of Data Analytics Journey

## Project Introduction
As a graduate of the HyperionDev data science bootcamp, I come into this 50-day data analytics journey equipped with foundational skills in Python and data analysis. However, I recognise the importance of continually honing and expanding my knowledge to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving field of data science. This project serves as an opportunity for me to further cement my existing skills and knowledge while revisiting and reinforcing techniques previously learned. By completing 50 data analytic tasks over the course of this journey, I aim to deepen my understanding of Python programming, data manipulation, and statistical analysis techniques. Through meticulous organisation and documentation of each task, I intend to create a comprehensive timeline and development map that not only showcases my progress but also highlights areas for further growth. Additionally, I aspire to enhance my skills in data visualisation and dashboard creation, ultimately becoming a more proficient and confident data analyst capable of tackling complex real-world data challenges with ease.
